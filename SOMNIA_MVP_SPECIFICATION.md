# Burnie Platform MVP Specification for Somnia Dreamathon

## 1. üöÄ Project Overview

**Project Name:**

Burnie - AI-Powered Content Creation Platform

**One-Liner:**

Burnie is a decentralized AI content generation platform where miners create personalized content using AI agents, yappers purchase and customize content with their avatars, and Web3 projects automate their social media presence.

**Problem Statement:**

Content creators struggle to scale quality content production across multiple platforms, while social media users lack access to high-performing, personalized content. Web3 projects need consistent, brand-aligned content but face high costs and time constraints. Current solutions are centralized, expensive, and lack the personalization and cross-platform optimization needed for viral success.

**Solution Summary:**

Burnie creates a decentralized marketplace where AI-powered miners generate multi-modal content (text, images, videos) using personalized agents. Yappers can purchase this content and customize it with their own avatars. Web3/Web2 projects can launch campaigns and receive automated, brand-consistent content. The platform leverages Somnia's high-speed blockchain for real-time transactions, instant payouts, and micro-payment viability.

**Target Users:**

- **Content Creators/Miners**: Influencers and creators who want to scale content production using AI agents (5,000+ target)
- **Yappers**: Social media users seeking high-quality, customizable content (20,000+ target)  
- **Web3/Web2 Projects**: Companies needing automated, brand-consistent social media content (500+ target)

## 9. üí° Somnia Advantage

Burnie's success fundamentally depends on Somnia's unique capabilities. The platform requires ultra-high throughput to support thousands of simultaneous content generation operations and instant micro-payments for content purchases. Traditional blockchains cannot handle the real-time nature of content creation, avatar personalization, and immediate creator payouts that define our user experience.

Somnia's gaming and social media focus aligns perfectly with our target market of content creators, influencers, and Web3 projects. The network's sub-second finality enables the responsive, real-time features that users expect from modern content platforms, while the low transaction costs make micro-payments and frequent interactions economically viable. Additionally, Somnia's performance allows for dual content storage - fast S3 access for marketplace display and immutable blockchain storage for true decentralized ownership and data provenance. This combination of performance, cost-efficiency, and market alignment makes Somnia the only blockchain capable of supporting Burnie's vision of decentralized, AI-powered content creation.
