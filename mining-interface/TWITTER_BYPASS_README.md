# Twitter Authentication Bypass - Temporary Configuration

## Overview
Twitter authentication has been temporarily bypassed for both regular and dedicated miners. The Twitter connection code is preserved and can be easily re-enabled.

## Current State
- ✅ **Dedicated Miners (`MINER=1`)**: Skip Twitter → Go directly to Dashboard
- ✅ **Regular Miners (`MINER=0`)**: Skip Twitter → Go directly to Dashboard (TEMPORARY)

## How to Re-enable Twitter Authentication for Regular Miners

To restore the original behavior where regular miners must connect Twitter:

### 1. Update `useTwitterConnection.ts`
```typescript
// Change this line from:
const skipTwitter = true // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement

// To:
const skipTwitter = false // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement
```

### 2. Update `useAuthGuard.ts`
```typescript
// Change this line from:
const skipTwitter = true // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement

// To:
const skipTwitter = false // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement
```

### 3. Update `page.tsx`
```typescript
// Change this line from:
const skipTwitter = true // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement

// To:
const skipTwitter = false // Set to false to re-enable Twitter requirement
```

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useTwitterConnection.ts` - Added skipTwitter flag
- `src/hooks/useAuthGuard.ts` - Added skipTwitter logic
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Added skipTwitter handling

## Original Behavior (when skipTwitter = false)
- **Dedicated Miners (`MINER=1`)**: Skip Twitter → Dashboard
- **Regular Miners (`MINER=0`)**: Require Twitter → Dashboard

## Current Behavior (when skipTwitter = true)
- **All Miners**: Skip Twitter → Dashboard

## Notes
- All Twitter-related code is preserved and functional
- The bypass is controlled by a single boolean flag in each file
- Debug logging shows the current state of the skipTwitter flag
- No Twitter-related code was deleted, only conditionally bypassed
