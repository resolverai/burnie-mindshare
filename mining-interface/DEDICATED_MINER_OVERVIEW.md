# Burnie Mining Interface - Dedicated Miner Overview

## What is the Burnie Mining Interface?

The Burnie Mining Interface is a specialized platform for **dedicated content miners** who want automated content generation for cryptocurrency campaigns. It's a "content factory" that runs 24/7, creating high-quality social media content based on market demand.

## Who Are Dedicated Miners?

Dedicated miners are content creators who:
- Have configured AI agents and neural keys (API access to AI services)
- Want to generate content automatically without manual intervention
- Trust the platform to optimize their content creation for maximum impact

## How Does It Work?

### **Market-Driven Content Generation**
The system monitors the content marketplace to identify "hot" campaigns where demand exceeds supply. When detected, it automatically triggers content generation.

### **Smart Campaign Selection**
- **Top 10 Campaigns**: Focuses on top campaigns by purchase volume
- **Hot Criteria**: A campaign becomes "hot" when:
  - Available content is sold out but people are still buying
  - The purchase-to-availability ratio exceeds 1:1

### **Automated Content Creation**
When a hot campaign is identified, the system:
- Selects appropriate post type (thread, shitpost, or longpost)
- Uses your configured AI agents and neural keys
- Generates content matching campaign requirements
- Ensures quality through AI-powered analysis

## Key Features
