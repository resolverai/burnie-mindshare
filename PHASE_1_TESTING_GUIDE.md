FROM platform_snapshots
ORDER BY upload_timestamp DESC;

-- Check processed data
SELECT id, processed_data->>'confidence' as confidence,
       processed_data->'leaderboard' as leaderboard_data
FROM platform_snapshots 
WHERE processing_status = 'completed';

-- Check daily intelligence
SELECT platform_source, intelligence_date, 
       trending_topics, algorithm_patterns
FROM daily_intelligence
ORDER BY intelligence_date DESC;
```
