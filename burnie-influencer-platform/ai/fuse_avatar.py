ORIGINAL TWEET TEXT:
{original_tweet_text}

ORIGINAL IMAGE PROMPT:
{original_image_prompt}

TASK:
Generate adapted content that integrates the avatar (second image) into the marketing scene (first image) while maintaining the campaign's core message.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON only, no markdown):
{{
  "new_tweet_text": "Rewritten tweet in first person from avatar's perspective, maintaining original meaning and call-to-action",
  "fusion_image_prompt": "Detailed prompt to integrate avatar into the original scene, connecting them naturally with the project logo"

REQUIREMENTS:
- new_tweet_text: Convert to first person ("I" instead of "Yo"), keep casual tone, preserve key metrics/facts, maintain urgency
- fusion_image_prompt: 
  * Specify exact positioning of avatar in the scene based on what you see in both images
  * Show natural interaction between avatar and existing elements
  * Connect the project logo visually to the avatar (reflection, proximity, gesture)
  * Preserve all original scene elements (backgrounds, effects, symbols)
  * Maintain technical specifications (8K, lighting, style)
  * Integrate the avatar's distinctive appearance (clothing, style) from the second image
  * Never include text/words in the image
